# Handling Asynchronous Operations


1. Callback Functions - These are the most basic way of handling asynchronous operations. When the asynchronous task is done, the callback function will be called. By using a callback function we can know that the code in the callback function will not be executed ultil the asynchronous task has completed. 

2. Promises - Promises are newer method of handling asynchronous tasks which have evolved to solve many of the problems that originated with strictly using callback functions.
